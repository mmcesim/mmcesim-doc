Before diving into documentation details, let's first have a preview of mmCEsim.
Maybe you are not sure whether your research or study need this powerful tool,
then read this chapter to have a glimpse of mmCEsim.

\section{Introduction}

The application is dedicated to simulate
millimeter wave (mmWave) channel estimation:
\[
  \text{mmCEsim}
  =\text{\textbf{mm}Wave}
  +\text{\textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}stimation}
  +\text{\textbf{sim}ulation},
\]
where reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),
also known as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) \cite{wu2019towards} is supported
for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems.

We offer a task-oriented simulation software for researchers to focus on algorithms only
without being bothered by coding.

\section{Features}

Here is a list of basic features of mmCEsim:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Task-oriented mmWave channel estimation formulation;
  \item Customizable system model;
  \item Extendable algorithms with our designed ALG language;
  \item Multiple RISs support;
  \item Automatic report generation (in plain text and \LaTeX{} PDF);
  \item Well-written documentation with examples and tutorials.
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm Background}

The task-oriented channel estimation for (RIS-assisted) mmWave MIMO systems
is implemented with compressed sensing (CS),
which exploits the sparsity of mmWave channels.

\section{Software Implementation}
Based on the algorithm background,
we implement this software with
command line interface (CLI),
graphic user interface (GUI),
web application and a VS Code extension.
The workflow of mmCEsim is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:mmCEsim_workflow}.
