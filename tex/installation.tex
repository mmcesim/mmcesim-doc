So far, there is no built binary for mmCEsim since it is still under development.
However, you may clone the GitHub repository and compile it yourself.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh, morekeywords={git, cmake, make}]
git clone https://github.com/mmcesim/mmcesim --recurse-submodules
cd mmcesim
cmake .
make
\end{lstlisting}
