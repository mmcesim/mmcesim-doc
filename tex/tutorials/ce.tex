Millimeter wave channel estimation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
techniques are discussed in \cite{lee2016channel}.

A novel channel estimation algorithm
\textit{orthogonal matching pursuit list-sparse Bayesian learning} (OMPL-SBL)\index{OMPL-SBL}\index{OMPL}\index{orthogonal matching pursuit list}
is proposed in \cite{zhao2023ompl},
which also reviews the compressed channel estimation scheme for RIS-aided MIMO systems.
The structure of angular domain sparsity is also discussed.

The employed automatic beamforming scheme is proposed in \cite{you2023beam}.
