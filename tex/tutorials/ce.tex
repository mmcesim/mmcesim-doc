Millimeter wave channel estimation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
techniques are discussed in \cite{lee2016channel}.

A novel channel estimation algorithm
\textit{orthogonal matching pursuit list-sparse Bayesian learning} (OMPL-SBL)
is proposed in \cite{zhao2023ompl},
which also reviews the compressed channel estimation scheme for RIS-aided MIMO systems.
The structure of angular domain sparsity is also discussed.
